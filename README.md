# Workout Tracker

This app allows the user to create a workout, saving a collection of exercises together as the workout.  The user can add more exercises to the current workout plan or start a new workout plan.  The Workout Tracker will combine the exercise totals on a "stats" page.

# Specifications

The Workout Tracker application uses Express, Node.js, MongoDB and Mongoose.  It is deployed on Heroku.  The front-end code is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and was given as part of the assignment.

As a developer my job was to develop the Mongo database model, Mongoose schema and Express routes.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.
